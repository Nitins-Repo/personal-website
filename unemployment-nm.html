        <strong>Role:</strong> Project Manager |
        <strong>Company:</strong> Deloitte |
        <strong>Period:</strong> Oct 2012 – Mar 2013
      </p>

      <p class="desc">
        Delivered New Mexico’s first integrated tax and benefits system. Led
        documentation, operations manuals, and readiness activities to support
        statewide rollout and achieve client acceptance for a major modernization
        initiative.

      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        As Project Manager, I supported the delivery of New Mexico’s first fully
        integrated Unemployment Insurance tax and benefits system. This effort
        replaced legacy processes with a unified platform designed to improve
        accuracy, compliance, and operational efficiency across the state’s UI
        program.
      </p>

      <p>
        My responsibilities focused on preparing the program for production
        readiness — including documentation, operational manuals, training
        materials, and acceptance processes — ensuring that the state had the tools
        and clarity needed to operate the new system effectively.
