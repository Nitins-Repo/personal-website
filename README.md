# Personal Website (Vite)

Simple Vite-based scaffold for a personal website.

## Quick start (Windows)

Open a terminal in the project root and run:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the displayed localhost URL in your browser.

## Build

```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview
```

If you want React/TypeScript or a different setup, tell me and I can re-scaffold.
