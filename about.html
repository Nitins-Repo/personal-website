  <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
  <p>
    I am a technology leader with more than 25 years of experience delivering
    large‑scale solutions for State and Local Government agencies. My work spans
    the full software development lifecycle, with deep domain expertise across
    <strong>Health and Human Services</strong>, <strong>Unemployment Insurance</strong>,
    <strong>Retirement Systems</strong>, and <strong>Transportation</strong> programs.
    Throughout my career, I’ve helped modernize complex legacy platforms,
    streamline operations, and deliver systems that directly support millions of
    citizens.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, I serve as the <strong>Maintenance &amp; Operations Lead for Ohio’s
    Integrated Eligibility System</strong>, a statewide platform supporting
    Medicaid, SNAP, TANF, and Child Care programs for more than
    <strong>3 million residents</strong>. I oversee system performance,
    operational continuity, and multi‑vendor coordination across mission‑critical
    components that thousands of users rely on every day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond stabilizing and optimizing large public‑sector systems, I bring a
    strategic perspective on emerging technologies — including the use of
    <strong>AI, automation, and analytics</strong> to enhance service delivery,
    strengthen decision‑making, and improve operational efficiency. My focus is
    on integrating modern capabilities in ways that elevate program performance
    while maintaining the reliability, compliance, and scalability that
    government systems demand.
  </p>

  <p>
    My career has been built on leading diverse teams, driving modernization
    efforts, and ensuring that complex public‑sector programs operate with
    stability, clarity, and measurable impact.
  </p>

  <h2>Leadership Approach</h2>
  <p>

    approach emphasizes cross‑team alignment, transparent communication, and
    building systems that are resilient, scalable, and easy to operate. Whether
    guiding modernization efforts or managing day‑to‑day operations, I prioritize
    stability, user experience, and long‑term sustainability.
