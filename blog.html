            <section class="post-intro">
              <p>
                Troubleshooting isn’t just a technical exercise. It’s a clarity exercise. In large programs, issues rarely show up as clean, 
                isolated failures. They surface as confusion — different teams seeing different symptoms, each holding a piece of the truth. 
                Over time, I’ve learned that the fastest way to cut through that noise is to anchor everything around one thing: the scenario.
              </p>

            <section class="post-section">
              <h2>Start With the Story, Not the Error</h2>
              <p>
                When something breaks, people naturally jump to the error message. I go the other direction. I ask for the story — who was doing 
                what, what they expected, what actually happened, when it occurred, and where in the workflow it surfaced. Once the story is clear, 
                the problem becomes grounded and easier to reason about.
              </p>

            <section class="post-section">
              <h2>Rebuild the Path</h2>
              <p>
                Every scenario follows a path through systems, teams, and decisions. I map that path in simple terms. Not to assign blame, but to 
                create shared understanding. When everyone sees the same picture, conversations shift from “our component is fine” to 
                “here’s where the behavior changes.”
              </p>
            </section>

            <section class="post-section">
              <h2>Look for the First Moment Things Stop Making Sense</h2>
              <p>
                There’s always a turning point — the first place where the scenario diverges from what should happen. That moment is more important 
                than the final error. It tells you where to focus, and just as importantly, where not to.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section class="post-section">
              <h2>Use Evidence, Not Assumptions</h2>
              <p>
                In complex environments, assumptions multiply quickly. I slow things down by asking for evidence — logs, timestamps, comparisons, 
                anything that grounds the discussion. This keeps the investigation honest and prevents teams from chasing shadows.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section class="post-section">
              <h2>Recreate the Scenario</h2>
              <p>
                If I can reproduce the issue, I can understand it. If I can understand it, I can fix it. Reproduction turns a vague problem into a 
                concrete one and gives everyone a controlled way to test ideas.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section class="post-section">
              <h2>Change One Thing at a Time</h2>
              <p>
                When pressure is high, teams want to change everything at once. I do the opposite. One change, one observation. It feels slower in 
                the moment but is dramatically faster overall because it leads to a real root cause, not a lucky guess.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section class="post-section">
              <h2>Document the Thinking, Not Just the Fix</h2>
              <p>
                A fix solves today’s problem. Documenting the thinking solves tomorrow’s. I capture the scenario, the turning point, the evidence, 
                and the reasoning. This builds organizational memory and reduces future escalations.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section class="post-section">
              <h2>Why This Approach Works</h2>
              <p>
                It brings order to chaos. It aligns teams. It replaces assumptions with clarity. And it turns troubleshooting from a reactive 
                scramble into a repeatable, confidence‑building process. It’s not about being technical — it’s about being disciplined, curious, 
                and structured when everything around you feels noisy.
